                cut,
                every colour, every shave is done with the utmost love, care and attention to detail. We love what we
                do,
                and nothing makes us happier than seeing our clients walk out of our salon looking their best - proudly
                showing off their new hair style along with a beaming smile. This makes us proud. So if you need a trim
                or
                fancy a new look, come and let us take care of you.</p>

                cruelty-free. You can relax, safe in the knowledge that whatever we’re using to style your hair has been
                checked and comes from an ethical and responsible place. There is enough cruelty in this world, and we
                believe that hairdressers and barbers can do their bit.</p>

                you don’t mind sitting in our waiting area while we take care of someone’s hair style, you can enjoy
                watching us do what we do best while sitting in our waiting area, enjoy looking through styling
                magazines or join-in with the conversation.

                senior citizens have earned the right to some friendly pricing, while children generally have smaller
                heads and parents have limited budgets, so we provide special prices for children under 12, plus those
